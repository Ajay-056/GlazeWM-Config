Take a look at my other configs and dots below

**Pro-tips:**

- Run Glaze WM as administrator to make sure all the features are enabled without any issues.
- Use shell:startup / Task Scheduler to run the executable automatically at the login.
- Use a Nerd Font to ensure all the icons and glyphs render properly. Download your favourite font from here <https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads>.
- Hide Your Task bar to freeup some unwanted space since taskbar is replaced by glaze WM bar / Zebar.
- Add custom scripts like VBS,PS1 etc in zebar to make the life more easier (I personally have added VBS for, click memory icon to open task manager & to open calendar by clicking time)
- Use GlazeWM alongside Powertoys Run (To mimic like dmenu or rofi) <https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys>
- Use Explorer Tab Utility to merge new file explorer windows as new tab in existing window to avoid clutter <https://github.com/w4po/ExplorerTabUtility>
