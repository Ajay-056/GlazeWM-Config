**Pro-tips:**

- Run Glaze WM as administrator to make sure all the features are enabled without any issues.
- Use shell:startup / Task Scheduler to run the executable automatically at the login.
- Use a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) to ensure all the icons and glyphs render properly.
- Hide Your Task bar to freeup some unwanted space since taskbar is replaced by Zebar / YASB.
- Add custom scripts like VBS,PS1,AHK etc in zebar to make the life more easier (Refer to zebar features section for more details)
- Use GlazeWM alongside any application launchers like [Flow Launcher](https://github.com/Flow-Launcher/Flow.Launcher) / [Powertoys Run](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys) To mimic like dmenu or rofi.
- Use [Explorer Tab Utility](https://github.com/w4po/ExplorerTabUtility) to merge new file explorer windows as new tab in existing window to avoid clutter (..and more).
